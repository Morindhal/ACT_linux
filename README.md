# ACT_linux

Depends on having espeak installed for TTS functionality, however should be able to parse without it.

A linux friendly combat parser for EQ2 primarily.
Cannot yet parse heal-parses but displays DPS parses when solo at least, I have yet to test in group/raid context.



This is very much a work in progress, currently uses a hard-coded path to the log-file.

Look into using a clipboard library for exporting parses.

PS. since using regular expressions this program could in the future easilly be expanded to work for other online games that support timestamped logs.
